 # Round Robin Tournament Scheduler

## Introduction

The Round Robin Tournament Scheduler is a software tool designed to generate a fair, conflict-free schedule for sports leagues using a round-robin format. It ensures that each participant competes against every other participant a set number of times in a round-robin tournament. The tool efficiently manages logistical constraints such as venue availability, predefined time slots, and rules like mandatory rest periods to create a well-structured and balanced schedule.

By automating the scheduling process, this tool simplifies league planning, ensuring efficiency, fairness, and optimal venue utilization while dynamically handling complex constraints. It minimizes scheduling conflicts, ensures participants have adequate rest between matches, and organizes matches in a logical, structured manner. Designed as an essential resource for league organizers, the scheduler enhances tournament management by eliminating the challenges of manual scheduling and ensuring a seamless competition flow.

### Problem Instance

A soccer league wants to host a single round-robin tournament that features five teams in total. The tournament will span over two days, and the league has access to two venues throughout the span of the tournament. Matches can start as early as 9 AM, and matches can finish as late as 5 PM. To prevent the teams from playing consecutive matches and to allow for travel to different venues if necessary, there is a minimum 90-minute rest period between matches for every team.

## Inputs

To generate the tournament schedule, all the input will be read from a file that contains the following details:

- **Round-robin type**
- **Participants**
- **Duration** (number of days)
- **Start Time** (24-hour format)
- **End Time** (24-hour format)
- **Match Length** (in minutes)
- **Number of Venues Available**
- **Rest Period** (in minutes)

### Example Input File for Soccer Round-Robin Tournament (.txt file):

```
1     			            -- round-robin type (1 indicates single round robin)
TEAM A                  -- list of participants
TEAM B
TEAM C
TEAM D
TEAM E
END                     -- finish reading list of teams
3		                    -- number of days
9:00                    -- start time
17:00                   -- end time
90                      -- match length (in minutes)
2                       -- number of venues available
90                      -- rest period (in minutes)
```
"--" is used to represent comments in the input file.

## Valid Solution

Based on the participants, the program will get the number of participants represented by `numParticipants`, and use that value to compute the total number of matches that need to be scheduled during the tournament. To determine the number of matches that will occur, the following formula will be used:

Total number of matches = `(numParticipantsÂ² - numParticipants) / 2`

Each participant in the tournament will play `numParticipants - 1` matches in a single round-robin tournament. In the case of the soccer tournament example, since there are five teams, there will be a total of ten matches, with each team playing four matches. The following matches will need to be scheduled:

`TEAM A vs TEAM B`
`TEAM A vs TEAM C`
`TEAM A vs TEAM D`
`TEAM A vs TEAM E`
`TEAM B vs TEAM C`
`TEAM B vs TEAM D`
`TEAM B vs TEAM E`
`TEAM C vs TEAM D`
`TEAM C vs TEAM E`
`TEAM D vs TEAM E`

The program must get all the matches that need to be scheduled, then it will take the first match (`TEAM A vs TEAM B`) and place it in the first available spot (`DAY 1, Venue 1, 09:00-10:30`). It will then move on to the next match, where it searches for an available spot in `DAY 1, Venue 1`. Since it is another match played by `TEAM A`, there has to be at least a 90-minute gap after the first match. The program continues scheduling matches, filling up spots in different venues, but still making sure that the constraints, such as rest periods, are being taken into account.

### Example Output for Soccer Round-Robin Tournament (printed onto console):

```
DAY 1:
Venue 1:
 09:00-10:30: TEAM A vs TEAM B
 12:00-13:30: TEAM A vs TEAM C
 15:00-16:30: TEAM A vs TEAM D
Venue 2:
 09:00-10:30: TEAM C vs TEAM D
 12:00-13:30: TEAM B vs TEAM D
 15:00-16:30: TEAM B vs TEAM C

DAY 2:
Venue 1:
 09:00-10:30: TEAM A vs TEAM E
 12:00-13:30: TEAM B vs TEAM E
 15:00-16:30: TEAM C vs TEAM E

DAY 3:
Venue 1:
 09:00-10:30: TEAM D vs TEAM E
```

In the output, notice that:

- No team plays another game until after a minimum of 90 minutes have passed since their previous match has ended, regardless of venue.
- No team has multiple matches on the same day at the same time at different venues.
- Teams can have multiple matches at the same time, but on different days.
- No matches are scheduled on `Day 2 at Venue 2`, hence not printed onto the console.

If there is no possible schedule for the given input, then the console will print:

```
A schedule was not able to be generated based on the input
```

### Key Features

1. **Flexible Scheduling**: Supports single and double round-robin tournaments
2. **Constraint Management**:
   - Respects minimum rest periods between matches
   - Prevents venue time conflicts
   - Ensures no participant plays multiple matches simultaneously
3. **Dynamic Match Generation**: Automatically creates matchups based on participants
4. **Detailed Input Validation**: Comprehensive input file validation
5. **Configurable Parameters**:
   - Tournament duration
   - Daily time slots

### Scheduling Algorithm

The scheduler uses a depth-first search (backtracking) approach to:
- Explore possible match assignments
- Prioritize venue and time slot filling
- Ensure all constraints are met
- Backtrack when a valid schedule cannot be found

## Implementation

The programming language to be implemented in is C++ and VS Code as the development environment. A depth-first search approach will be used to explore and assign match schedules efficiently while adhering to constraints. The scheduling process will prioritize filling venues, days, and time slots in a structured order. Matches will first be assigned to the first venue before considering subsequent venues, ensuring optimal space utilization. Similarly, the scheduler will prioritize earlier days before moving to later ones, maintaining a logical match progression. Within each day, earlier time slots will be filled first, minimizing scheduling gaps and reducing the need for adjustments based on rest periods.
